# Questions


1. Is it a Freetier only feature, or only clients with its own infrastructure? Is there anything we would not want to ingest if user is in freetier?

2. What about duplicates? Let's say the user create model x, and mlflow has a model called 'model x', what do we do? (suggestion, append a `-2` in the model being imported).
